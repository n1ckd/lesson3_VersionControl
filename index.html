            <p class="lead">A version control system is a way of managing files for a project. It allows different versions or stages of a project to exist at once. These versions can be edited and changed completely from one another and not interfere with other versions of the project. Version control systems can be applied to many types of projects. Version control systems can be used to record changes to documents, websites, programs and other collections of information. The most common types of people who will use version control systems are developers or people working with code to write software and programs.</p>

            <p class="lead">This allows for multiple people to work on the same project at the same time without overwriting their coworkers changes. This is also useful if a developer is working on a project and makes a mistake that leaves it corrupt or deletes his work, if they are using a version control system they will have a backup. Version Control Systems also allow developers to organize and document their progress. If their projects are uploaded to a remote repository like github or bitbucket they will be available online and can be accessed by other developers working on the project.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"></p>Git is a widely used decentralized version control system. Git is one of the most common version control systems used by developers to manage their work on a project or projects. Git sees stages of a project as different snapshots or instances of the developers work. It stores these snapshots as individual data instead of changes to one group of files. It is designed to almost never remove data and have a backup or original copy of everything the developer does. This allows developers to never lose data and experience a setback, it also allows them to revisit previous instances of their project if they decide they liked a previous version more.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Github is a website that acts as a remote repository for developers using a version control system. It is a web based hosting system that uses Git. It allows developers to manage and publish their projects. By publishing their projects it allows them to share their ideas with the community in a easy and accessible open source format. Github works to promote communities to work towards open source projects. It also allows developers to work on the same project without interfering or overwriting each others work. Github also allows developers to establish themselves on a free and popular network and showcase their work.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The workflow of git and github can be broken down into a few basic commands that can save projects and development teams a great deal of grief. The main three commands are add commit and push. The add command saves changes to your project that you have made in your local repository. The add command places the version in the staging area where it will then be committed. The commit command will apply these changes to the repository and then these changed files will be pushed. The push command will send a unique version of the project to the remote repository where it can be accessed again by the developers. </p>
